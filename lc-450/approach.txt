Since it is a BST, we should keep in mind that the inorder traversal of BST
goves us an array of ascending order of items

we have 3 scenarios in here

1. node is a leaf, just go ahead and dorectly delete it and make it null

2. node has a left and a right chilld, find the successor, to go right one step and left till the end


3. node has a right and a left child, find the predeccesor, to gp left one step and right to the furthest step
