To find the closest element, you need to find the range

// Simple Binary Search with a small tweak in the condition

if the difference between the element and the mid value is

 * is greater than the difference between element and the element from the last range

   It clearly means you need to move closer to the right part, which is low = mid + 1

* If the it less than the part of the other range,

  It clealy means it should move be in the left part and hence, right = mifd
