Use min priority queue approach

Initially store the min elements in the heap

// Then move the element in the list, which has the min element, so that we recalculate the
range and we should have a max value for the min value

// every time when you check for the max element in the min element, update
the max value whether it has impacted or not

// finally you will have the value
