// The idea is to find the smallest range, which is the min and the max 
from the lists which the smallest range possible

// If we compare normally, we will get O(n * k) where k is the number of lists
and n is the number of elements

// It is better to use min heap, so that every time we woould use to heapify and get the minimmum element
