1. Store the pattern in the map

2. start looping through the window, and decrement the chars in the map

3. when the counter is 0, check for the length and add it to the result

4. then move the window, start adding the char in the left 

5. for each found, decrement the count, if it is in the map,

6. Repeat the same steps, so that the map counter plays an important role in here
