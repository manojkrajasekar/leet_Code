we can proably use the backtracking approach to generate all the possible permutations

and when we bakctrack, we can have a count variable and then compare it with the value of the permutations

n = 3, k = 3

3 rd permutation from 

123
132
213
231
312
321

the number of possibilities will be from 1 to n
for each iteration, we need to place the number at the corresponding index and calculate the value of the permutation


This is an inefficient approach as we might go up to the n! sequence, which will cost use
n! time complexoty
