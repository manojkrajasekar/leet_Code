find the path from the start to the end of the matrix

find all the paths from start to end

for each path, get the min value, and then compare it with the min value for other path

// at the end, we will have the max min value in the path from start to end


traverse(0, 0)


// traverse in all the four directions
// have a boundary check
// once it reaches the end, return the min value, and then from that point, the dfs will continue
// once dfs is done, compare it with the max value of the other path
