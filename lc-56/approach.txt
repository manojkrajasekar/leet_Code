Sort the Intervals as they would be of different sets and timings

Start looping throgh the array of intervals

if the A[1] >= B[0], we need to merge it.

One case to be considered is, after we merge, we need to make the prev element as

the new element

Once you merge the items, revert back the index to the previous element in the arr

Ask Clarifying questions

Then it must become A[1], and then or just shift the first element in the array

Then continue doing the search, finally you will have the merge intervals

TIme complexity would be O(nlogn)
