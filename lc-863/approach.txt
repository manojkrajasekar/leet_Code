// Since we need to get the distance equally, the problem would be accessing topwards from the node
below and account for the distance

// To address that, we need to use the queue and get the elements including the parent

// Initially calculate the parent and child nodes and store it in Set

// Child -> parent

like checking for left and right values, check for the parent value as well
