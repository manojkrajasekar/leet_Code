Goal: To find the top k frequent elements

Approach 1:

1. loop through the array and find the elements and store it in a hash map

2. value is the occurenecs

2. sort the map based on the value, i.e is the occurences by descending order

// While you do the above operation, you will get the items

But the time complexity will be linear and then lograthmic
so, nlogn

we must have something better than nlogn, as that is the requirement

// Better approach will be to use a Max Heap, where we store the elements with 

/// everytime you insert, max heapify based on the occurences
