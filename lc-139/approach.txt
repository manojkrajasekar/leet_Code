// start reading through the characters of the string
// for each index, slice the portion
// check if the sliced portion is present in the word dictionary
// if so, then recursively call the function with the reamaining part
// keep doing so
// when the remaining part is empty, then it means it is true
// when the last portion is not found in anyways of the dict, then return false

// If we do not use memoization, when it looks for other words deeper.
// It will be exponential and will timeout
// so we need to cache the results
