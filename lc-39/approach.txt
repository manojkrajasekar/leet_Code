In order to find the whole combination sum. you need to choose each element

from the arr, and then start repeating it till it equals to or exceeds the target

// If it exceeds, just remove the last element and then return, choode the next element

// Do this starting from each number in the array and build up the tree


Time complexity woudd be n! if we use memoization
