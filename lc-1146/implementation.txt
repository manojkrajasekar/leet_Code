// Initialize an empty array with a given length

// Set the array element

//Everytime when we take a snap, we need to store all the elements, and have an entry

for each snap Id

// In this case, we can use a Map, to store the snap Id as the key,
and value as the whole array
// based on the index, and the snap Id, we can get the value from
the Map
