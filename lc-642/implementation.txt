// Store the sentence and the occurences in the hashMap

// Sort it based on the occcurences, top 3 or so will have the same degree of hotness

// But we need to use a trie, to store the value based on the sentence

// i love you - 5 

// island - 3

// ironman - 2

i -> ' ' -> l 
  -> s -> l
  -> r -> o
  -> ' ' -> l

At the end of thr trie element -> the frequency is the value
When they are qual then, we need to compare each values

Get the value typed from the prefix and then search it in the Map, which begins
with that and get the ones with most frequent occuring

i -> i(5) -> love()
  -> i(3) -> s()
  -> i(2) -> r
